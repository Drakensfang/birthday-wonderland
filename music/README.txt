INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADDING YOUR SOUNDTRACK
========================================

1. Place your music file in this folder

2. Rename it to: soundtrack.mp3
   (or keep your original name and update index.html)

3. Supported formats:
   - MP3 (most common, works everywhere)
   - OGG (optional, for better browser compatibility)
   - WAV (works but large file size)

4. Recommended:
   - Use MP3 format for best compatibility
   - Keep file size reasonable (under 10MB is good)
   - The music will loop automatically
   - Users can toggle it on/off with the music button

5. If your file has a different name:
   - Update line 12 in index.html
   - Change "music/soundtrack.mp3" to "music/YOUR-FILE-NAME.mp3"

Your folder structure should look like:
birthday-wonderland/
├── music/
│   └── soundtrack.mp3  <-- Your music file here
├── images/
├── index.html
└── ... (other files)

The music will deploy to Vercel along with everything else!
